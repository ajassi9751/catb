This project is catb which is just a dumb project which prints out file contents in bianary
 (and has a flag to output a file in integer form). 
The name comes from the cat command with b for bianary. 
To use (for linux) first git clone this repo, then use your favorite c compiler (for example gcc) 
and compile it with the name catb (with gcc the command would be: gcc -o catb main.c). 
Now copy or move the bianary into the /usr/local/bin folder and it should work! 
Im not sure how to make this work for windows and mac. 
Currently the flag doesn't work and the project doesn't have much extensibility. 
I will also soon add a bash file to auto compile and copy the file for you.
